top # shows the processes running
htop # similar to top, but more interactive
xargs # I think it is useful to execute commands giving parameters that I computed with bash. E.g.: ls | grep filename | xargs cat
grep -o -e expr1 -e expr2 # -o makes grep output only the matched expression, without its context. -e is used for starting a regular expression and we can use more than one
uname -r # check kernel version
fc-match <font-name> # check what font does fontconfig match with the given pattern (e.g. fc-match helvetica)
