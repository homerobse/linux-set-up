htop # similar to top, but more interactive
xargs # I think it is useful to execute commands giving parameters that I computed with bash. E.g. to print contents of searched files: ls | grep filename | xargs cat
uname -r # check kernel version
fc-match <font-name> # check what font does fontconfig match with the given pattern (e.g. fc-match helvetica)

# search
grep -o -e expr1 -e expr2 # -o makes grep output only the matched expression, without its context. -e is used for starting a regular expression and we can use more than one
grep -iwrn 'path-to-folder' -e 'pattern' -C5 # search for text in files:  i for ignore case, r for recurrent directory search, n for line number, w for match whole word, -Cn for n lines of context  https://stackoverflow.com/a/30138655/1273751
