## Linux is better than Windows

I catch myself hating Linux, so I decided to write this list of reasons to why I use it to try and placate my anger in any of those times.

* Some benchmarks show that Python runs faster on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04)
  - Check PyBench https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ryzen3-windows-linux&num=8
* it does not get as slow as windows does after years of it having been installed
* bash terminal is better than windows CLI/powershell, and it is what I will have to use when connecting to remote servers, which usually run on Linux
  - `ls` lists files in a short format when compared to `dir`
  - `grep` is an easy way to search for files or results, but maybe there's a way to do this is windows
  - `alias` makes it easy to access folders through a single command. No easy way to create aliases in windows
- after installing software, there is generally no need to restart
- less viruses, no need for anti-virus

This was partly based on http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/10-reasons-why-linux-is-better-than-windows

## Windows is better than Linux 

In 2020 I switched from Linux to Windows. Mainly because of several reasons why Linux becomes annoying:

* MS Powerpoint doesn't work and Google slides videos are not available offline;
* Illustrator doesn't work well in Wine, Inkscape gets slow when there are many elements;
* Skype version for Linux does not show the pointer
* Issues with driver when moving photos from my phones' SD drive. There were errors when transferring large files (or maybe it was large amounts of picture files, which are not very big). The files ended up not being transfered and I had to repeat the operation.
* Okular inline notes cannot have transparent background. Chrome does not visualize Okular's inline notes. Adobe reader version in Ubuntu 16.04 had no commenting and highlighting features;
* Mindjet manager not available for Linux. Freemind manager not great.
* Zoom version for Linux has uglier interface and bugs in displaying participants when using in multiple monitors. But when there's someone sharing screen, Linux version windows can be flexibly and automatically resized into half the screens they are on, while windows one has to resize manually.

## General comment

Using a computer involves lots of configuration to set the system as one prefers. Both Windows and Linux become cumbersome when one has to do this. In both systems:

* Spotify hoards cache files using up a lot of space and I had to go into configurations to set things up so that the folder goes to the HDD rather than SSD.
