Once in a while I catch myself hating Linux, so I dedided to write this list of reasons to why I use it to try and placate my anger in any of those times.

* Some benchmarks show that Python runs faster on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04)
  - Check PyBench https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ryzen3-windows-linux&num=8
* it does not get as slow as windows does after years of it having been installed
* bash terminal is much better than windows CLI, and it is what I will have to use when connecting to remote servers, which usually run on Linux
- after installing software, there is generally no need to restart
- less viruses, no need for antivirus

This was partly based on http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/10-reasons-why-linux-is-better-than-windows

Some reasons why Linux can become annoying:
* MS Powerpoint doesn't work and google slides videos are not available offline;
* Illustrator doesn't work well in Wine, Inkscape gets slow when there are many elements;
* Skype version for Linux does not show the pointer
* Zoom version for Linux has uglier interface and some bugs when using in multiple monitors
* Issues with driver when moving photos from my phones' SD drive
* Okular inline notes cannot have transparent background. Chrome does not visualize its inline notes.
* Mindjet manager not available for Linux. Freemind manager not great.
