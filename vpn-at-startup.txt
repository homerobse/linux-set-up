https://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/question/10880/how-do-i-start-a-vpn-session-via-the-command-line/?answer=15623#post-id-15623

edit file /etc/vpnc/default.conf to contain:
    IPSec gateway vpn.ox.ac.uk
    IPSec ID oxford
    IPSec secret osiris
    Xauth username sjoh4589
    Xauth password net4phD


2 - Use this to make it a service that will run in startup: https://timleland.com/how-to-run-a-linux-program-on-startup/
$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/oxvpn.service



Extra (in the phone they ask for these addresses to connect always thorugh the VPN): 
To know the IP of the VPN address, run:
$ dig +short vpn.ox.ac.uk
163.1.94.21

or
$ host vpn.ox.ac.uk
vpn.ox.ac.uk has address 163.1.94.21

And the IP of the DNS server can be found in this Oxford IT link: https://help.it.ox.ac.uk/network/dns/dns-info
IP address 163.1.2.1 maps to dns2.ox.ac.uk.
